# PySide2 example


Requirements:

```
Python >=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*, !=3.4.*, <3.11
```
Other requirements are specified in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file and can be installed with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run instructions:
To run the program you have to run the [main.py](main.py) python script.

For the tasks and files to appear in the list you have to press the corresponding buttons underneath the list.
The same logic applies to the dropdown lists where you have to press the button next to it to add another _instance_ of it.

NOTE: this example is just a GUI implementation without any advanced logic behind it except the ability to add tasks, files, projects and categories.
